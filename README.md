Fiat is the authorization server for the Spinnaker system. 

It exposes a RESTful interface for querying the access permissions for a particular user. It currently supports three kinds of resources:
* Accounts
* Applications
* Service Accounts
 
---

### Accounts
Accounts are setup within Clouddriver and queried by Fiat for its configured `requiredGroupMembership` restrictions.

### Applications
Applications are the combination of config metadata pulled from Front50 and server group names (e.g., application-stack-details). Application permissions sit beside application configuration in S3/Google Cloud Storage.

### Service Accounts
Fiat Service Accounts are groups that act as a user during automated triggers (say, from a GitHub push or Jenkins build). Authorization is built in by making the service account a member of a group specified in `requiredGroupMembership`.

---

### User Role/Authorization Providers
There are currently two user role providers: Google Groups (through a Google Apps for Work organization) and GitHub Teams. If you would like to see additional providers, see [this issue](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/2437).
