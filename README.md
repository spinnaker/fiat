Fiat is the authorization server for the Spinnaker system. 

It exposes a RESTful interface for querying the access permissions for a particular user. It currently supports three kinds of resources:
* Accounts
* Applications
* Service Accounts
 
---

### Accounts
Accounts are setup within Clouddriver and queried by Fiat for its configured `requiredGroupMembership` restrictions.

### Applications
Applications are the combination of config metadata pulled from Front50 and server group names (e.g., application-stack-details). Application permissions sit beside application configuration in S3/Google Cloud Storage.

### Service Accounts
Fiat Service Accounts are groups that act as a user during automated triggers (say, from a GitHub push or Jenkins build). Authorization is built in by making the service account a member of a group specified in `requiredGroupMembership`.

---

### User Role/Authorization Providers
Currently supported user role providers are: 
* Google Groups (through a Google Apps for Work organization) 
* GitHub Teams
* LDAP
* File based role provider

---

### Modular builds
 By default, Fiat is built with authorization included. To build only a subset of 
providers, use the `includeProviders` flag:
 ```
./gradlew -PincludeProviders=google-groups,ldap clean build
```
 You can view the list of all providers in `gradle.properties`.

### Debugging

To start the JVM in debug mode, set the Java system property `DEBUG=true`:
```
./gradlew -DDEBUG=true
```

The JVM will then listen for a debugger to be attached on port 7103.  The JVM will _not_ wait for the debugger
to be attached before starting Fiat; the relevant JVM arguments can be seen and modified as needed in `build.gradle`.
