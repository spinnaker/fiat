/**
 * For a component that uses this annotation, the Fiat Spring Security configuration will be
 * applied. This does not mean that Fiat is required to be enabled, just that the whole service has
 * Spring Security layers and filters for requests/responses.
 *
 * With this annotation and Fiat disabled, the biggest difference is the ability to access the
 * Spring Management Server endpoints (/env, /beans, /autoconfig, etc). Most of these endpoints are
 * considered "sensitive", and therefore are disabled from an unauthenticated user requesting them
 * over HTTP. In order to still access them, you must use HTTP Basic authentication. See
 * http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html
 * for more details.
 *
 * With this annotation and Fiat enabled, @Controller invocations annotated with Fiat authorization
 * checks will be performed and enforced. The above Management Server endpoint information still
 * applies.
